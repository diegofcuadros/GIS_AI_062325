# Experimental GeoAI notebooks

## Earth Engine companion

[EE Companion](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/experimental/functionsmith/ee_companion.ipynb)
is a notebook with an agent that solves user tasks by writing EE code
in an interactive chat session.  Results are shown on geemap.

## Dataset Explorer

[Dataset Explorer](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/tree/master/experimental/scienceai_ee_dataset_explorer)
is a Google Research prototype notebook that searches the Earth Engine
catalog for datasets relevant to the user query.

## Earth Engine Genie

[EE Genie](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/experimental/ee_genie.ipynb)
is an notebook with an agent that and can analyze images retrieved from EE.

## Functionsmith

[Functionsmith](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/experimental/functionsmith/functionsmith.ipynb)
is a notebook with an agent that incrementally writes code to solve user
problems. This agent is not Earth Engine-specific.
