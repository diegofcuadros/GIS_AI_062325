"""Earth Engine Agent.

WARNING: THIS TOOL IS UNSAFE, AS IT AUTOMATICALLY RUNS LLM-GENERATED
PYTHON CODE! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE GENERATED CODE GIVES CORRECT ANSWERS
EVEN IF THE AGENT DECLARES SUCCESS.

Earth Engine Agent allows you to interact with the Earth Engine (EE) API
The agent utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to:
 * generate EE code snippets based on a user query
 * describe image tiles obtained from EE
 * decide whether the tile matches the query.

Usage:
   ee_agent <topic>

Arguments:
   <topic>  The topic or question you want to visualize using Earth Engine.

Examples:
   ee_agent Australia DEM
   ee_agent New York City

Prerequisites:
   Before running the tool, make sure to:
   - Install the required dependencies:
    `pip install earthengine-api google-generativeai pillow numpy matplotlib requests`
   - Configure authentication for the Earth Engine API by running
     `earthengine authenticate`.
     See https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/auth
   - Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable with your Google API
     key. See https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup

Description:
   Earth Engine Agent takes a topic or question as input and generates
   an Earth Engine code snippet that visualizes the requested information
   in one map tile. It uses LLMs to understand the user's query,
   generate appropriate EE code, and analyze the resulting map tile
   for relevance.

Implementation:
   The tool follows these steps:

   1. Takes the user's question as input.
   2. Uses an LLM (currently only Gemini is supported) to generate
      an EE code snippet based on the user's question.
   3. Executes the generated code snippet to retrieve a map tile URL
      from the EE API, trying to correct code execution errors.
   4. Uses Gemini image recognition to analyze the content and relevance
      of the retrieved map tile.
   5a. If the map tile is deemed relevant to the user's query, the agent
      displays the map tile using matplotlib and exits successfully.
   5b. If the map tile is not satisfactory, the agent tries again, using
      the LLM's feedback to refine the EE code.

   During the execution, the tool prints the generated EE code,
   the retrieved map tile URL, the LLM's analysis of the map tile,
   and any error messages encountered.

        other enhancement, so don\t penalize their absence. Make sure you

        uncertainty, express it in your analysis. Do not output information
