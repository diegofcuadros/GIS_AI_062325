This tutorial demonstrates how pseudo-invariant feature (PIF) matching can be
used to harmonize radiometric characteristics between images by applying the
technique to a pair of [Planet SkySat](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/SKYSAT_GEN-A_PUBLIC_ORTHO_MULTISPECTRAL)
images acquired before and after a deforestation event in Peru.

## Background

Relative radiometric normalization techniques like
[histogram matching](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/histogram-matching),
[multivariate alteration detection (MAD)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/imad-tutorial-pt1),
and PIF matching apply transformations between images that were acquired at
different times, under different conditions, or by different sensors,
reducing radiometric differences to allow for more accurate comparisons and
change detection ([Schroeder et al., 2006](#references)). PIF matching works by
identifying areas with minimal spectral change between images, known as
pseudo-invariant features, and applying a linear transformation to the entire
image based on the spectral differences between these areas.

## Input Data

The code below loads two Planet SkySat images acquired before and after a
logging operation in Peru, clips them to a small area of interest, selects the
relevant multispectral bands, and uses the
[`register`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-image-register)
method to correct a slight misregistration between images.

```javascript
var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point([-75.0608, -8.2736]).buffer(3000).bounds();
var bands = ee.List(['N', 'R', 'G', 'B']);

var before = ee.Image('SKYSAT/GEN-A/PUBLIC/ORTHO/MULTISPECTRAL/s02_20150804T151429Z')
  .select(bands)
  .clip(aoi);
var after = ee.Image('SKYSAT/GEN-A/PUBLIC/ORTHO/MULTISPECTRAL/s01_20150910T154218Z')
  .select(bands)
  .clip(aoi)
  .register(before, 100);
```

Adding the images to the map shows the radiometric mismatch between them:
the 'after' image appears much brighter than the 'before' image, making direct
comparisons more difficult.

```javascript
Map.centerObject(aoi);
Map.addLayer(before, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'Before');
Map.addLayer(after, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'After');
```

## Identifying Pseudo-Invariant Features

With the before and after images loaded and aligned, the next step is to
identify spectrally stable, pseudo-invariant features that can be used to
match the images. While PIFs *can* be selected manually by identifying
unchanged areas and digitizing points or polygons around them, this approach
can be time-consuming and subjective. Spectral distance metrics provide an
automated method for measuring similarity between pixels, which can then be
used to select a subset of pixels with the smallest spectral changes.

### Measuring Spectral Distance

The code below uses the [`spectralDistance`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-image-spectraldistance)
method to calculate spectral information divergence (SID) between the before
and after images. You can also experiment with other distance metrics like
spectral angle mapper (SAM) or squared euclidean distance (SED) to see how
they affect results.

```javascript
var distance = before.spectralDistance(after, 'SID');
Map.addLayer(distance, {min: 0, max: 0.4}, 'Spectral distance');
```

Visualizing spectral distance highlights areas of change that correspond with
logging, road construction, and cloud shadows:

### Selecting Stable Pixels

The next step is to select a subset of pixels that experienced little or no
change. This can be done by applying a percentile reducer over the area of
interest to identify a spectral distance threshold, then selecting pixels with
distances below that threshold. The code below uses a 10th percentile
threshold, but you may want to modify the percentile to see how it affects
results. Higher percentiles will select pixels with greater spectral distances,
allowing transformations to normalize larger radiometric differences at the
risk of introducing bias from outlying pixels.

```javascript
var threshold = distance.reduceRegion({
  reducer: ee.Reducer.percentile([10]),
  geometry: aoi,
  scale: 1,
  bestEffort: true,
  maxPixels: 1e6,
}).getNumber('distance');

var pif = distance.lt(threshold);
Map.addLayer(pif, {}, 'PIF mask');
```

## Applying the Transformation

With pseudo-invariant pixels identified, the next step is to build linear
transformations between these areas in the before and after image, which can
then be applied to the entire image. This can be done by mapping over each
band and:

1. Masking the before and after image to the PIF.
2. Using a [`linearFit`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-reducer-linearfit)
   reducer to calculate regression coefficients between the masked images in
   the area of interest.
3. Applying the linear coefficients to match the after image to the before
   image.

The function below applies all three steps to a single band for convenience:

```javascript
function matchBand(band) {
  var beforePif = before.select([band]).updateMask(pif);
  var afterPif = after.select([band]).updateMask(pif);

  var args = {
    reducer: ee.Reducer.linearFit(),
    geometry: aoi,
    scale: 1,
    maxPixels: 1e6,
    bestEffort: true
  };

  var coeffs = ee.Image.cat([afterPif, beforePif])
    .reduceRegion(args);

  return after
    .select([band])
    .multiply(coeffs.getNumber('scale'))
    .add(coeffs.getNumber('offset'));
}
```

Mapping that function over the list of `bands` defined at the beginning of
the tutorial will return a list of matched single-band images, which can then
be combined back into a multi-band image.

```javascript
var matchedBands = bands.map(matchBand);
var matched = ee.ImageCollection(matchedBands).toBands().rename(bands);
```

Here are the results, showing the before, after (matched), and after (original)
images:

```javascript
Map.addLayer(before, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'Before');
Map.addLayer(matched, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'After (Matched)');
Map.addLayer(after, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'After (Original)');
```

| *Before* | *After (Matched)* | *After (Original)* |
|:------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| ![Before image](pif_target.png) | ![After - matched](pif_matched.png) | ![After - original](pif_source.png) |


## Conclusion

The full code is below, or you can [open it in the Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/2519effefdc6e25ad98eb07b23a21999).

```javascript
// Select an area of interest and define multispectral bands to use
var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point([-75.0608, -8.2736]).buffer(3000).bounds();
var bands = ee.List(['N', 'R', 'G', 'B']);

// Select a pair of Planet SkySat images acquired before and after deforestation
var before = ee.Image('SKYSAT/GEN-A/PUBLIC/ORTHO/MULTISPECTRAL/s02_20150804T151429Z')
  .select(bands)
  .clip(aoi);
var after = ee.Image('SKYSAT/GEN-A/PUBLIC/ORTHO/MULTISPECTRAL/s01_20150910T154218Z')
  .select(bands)
  .clip(aoi)
  .register(before, 100);

// Calculate spectral distance as a measure of change between the images
var distance = before.spectralDistance(after, 'sid');

// Identify the 10th percentile of change
var threshold = distance.reduceRegion({
  reducer: ee.Reducer.percentile([10]),
  geometry: aoi,
  scale: 1,
  bestEffort: true,
  maxPixels: 1e6,
}).getNumber('distance');

// Define pseudo-invariant features below the change threshold
var pif = distance.lt(threshold);

function matchBand(band) {
  // Select just the PIF areas in each image
  var beforePif = before.select([band]).updateMask(pif);
  var afterPif = after.select([band]).updateMask(pif);

  // Define a linear reducer to calculate a transformation between images
  var args = {
    reducer: ee.Reducer.linearFit(),
    geometry: aoi,
    scale: 1,
    maxPixels: 1e6,
    bestEffort: true
    };

  // Calculate the linear coefficients
  var coeffs = ee.Image.cat([afterPif, beforePif])
    .reduceRegion(args);

  // Apply the coefficients to match the after band to the before band
  return after
    .select([band])
    .multiply(coeffs.getNumber('scale'))
    .add(coeffs.getNumber('offset'));
}

// Match each band, then combine them back into a single multi-band image
var matchedBands = bands.map(matchBand);
var matched = ee.ImageCollection(matchedBands).toBands().rename(bands);

Map.centerObject(aoi);
Map.addLayer(distance, {min: 0, max: 0.4}, 'Spectral distance');
Map.addLayer(pif, {}, 'PIF mask');
Map.addLayer(before, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'Before');
Map.addLayer(matched, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'After (Matched)');
Map.addLayer(after, {min: 1000, max: 5000}, 'After (Original)');
```
