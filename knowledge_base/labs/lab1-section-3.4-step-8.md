4. Maintain 20 segments for smooth circular buffers
5. Save output as 'facility_buffers_10km.shp'

### ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Buffer zones show reasonable access distances
- Higher segment count creates smoother circles

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: If buffers appear too large/small, check distance units
- **Issue**: Ensure project CRS uses meters for accurate measurements
- **Issue**: Verify input layer contains point features
