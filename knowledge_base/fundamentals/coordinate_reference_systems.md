# Understanding Coordinate Reference Systems

Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) define how locations on Earth are represented mathematically.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Geographic CRS**: Uses latitude/longitude (e.g., WGS84 - EPSG:4326)
- **Projected CRS**: Uses x,y coordinates in meters/feet (e.g., UTM zones)
- **EPSG Codes**: Standardized numerical identifiers for CRS

**Uganda Context:**
- **EPSG:4326 (WGS84)**: Global geographic system, good for general mapping
- **EPSG:32636 (UTM Zone 36N)**: Projected system for Uganda, better for measurements

**When to Use Each:**
- Geographic (4326): Web mapping, global datasets, initial data visualization
- Projected (32636): Distance measurements, area calculations, spatial analysis

**Common Issues:**
- Mixing different CRS in analysis can cause errors
- Always check your project CRS (bottom-right of QGIS)
- Reproject data when necessary for accurate measurements
