1. Public Health Context
1.1 Introduction to Malaria Epidemiology
What is Malaria?
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles
mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable, yet it continues to be a major public health challenge globally.
Key Facts:
5 parasite species cause malaria in humans
Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly
Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes
Symptoms include fever, headache, and vomiting
Can be fatal if untreated within 24 hours
Global Impact:
247 million cases globally in 2021
619,000 deaths in 2021
Children under 5 most vulnerable
95% of cases occur in Africa
Major cause of poverty and reduced productivity
1.2 Malaria Transmission Cycle
Figure 1.1: Malaria transmission cycle showing the complex interaction between human host, parasite, and mosquito vector
Human Stage
1. Infected mosquito bites human
2. Sporozoites enter bloodstream
3. Parasites travel to liver
4. Multiplication in liver cells
5. Release into bloodstream
6. Infection of red blood cells
7. Symptoms develop
Mosquito Stage
1. Mosquito bites infected human
2. Gametocytes ingested
3. Sexual reproduction in gut
4. Oocyst formation
5. Sporozoite development
6. Migration to salivary glands
7. Ready for transmission
1.3 Burden in Uganda
Uganda Malaria Statistics
Annual Cases~15 million
Deaths per Year~10,000-15,000
Population at Risk95% of population
Economic Impact$500 million annually
Healthcare Burden30-50% of outpatient visits

regions
1.4 Importance of Spatial Analysis in Disease Control
Why Map Disease?
Identify hotspots: Locate areas with high transmission
Resource allocation: Direct interventions where needed most
Monitor trends: Track changes over time and space
Evaluate programs: Assess intervention effectiveness
Predict outbreaks: Anticipate disease spread patterns
Applications in Malaria Control
Bed net distribution: Target high-risk areas
Indoor spraying: Prioritize intervention areas
Health facility planning: Improve access to care
Surveillance systems: Monitor disease patterns
Research planning: Guide scientific studies
2. GIS and Disease Mapping Fundamentals
2.1 Key Concepts and Terminology
TermDefinitionApplication in Health
GIS (Geographic Information
System)
A system for capturing, storing, analyzing, and
visualizing spatial data
Disease surveillance, outbreak investigation,
health service planning
Vector DataData represented as points, lines, or polygons
Health facilities (points), roads (lines), districts
(polygons)
Raster DataData stored in a grid of cells
Satellite imagery, elevation models, population
density
Attribute TableDatabase table linked to spatial featuresDisease counts, population data, health indicators
Choropleth Map

2.3 Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
Why CRS Matters in Health Mapping
Coordinate Reference Systems define how the curved surface of the Earth is represented on a flat map. Choosing the right CRS is
crucial for accurate distance measurements, area calculations, and spatial analysis in health applications.
Common CRS for Uganda:
WGS84 (EPSG:4326): Global standard for GPS
UTM Zone 36N (EPSG:32636): Best for eastern Uganda
UTM Zone 35N (EPSG:32635): Best for western Uganda
Health Applications:
Accurate distance calculations
Proper area measurements
Spatial analysis accuracy
GPS data integration
2.4 Choropleth Mapping Principles
Choropleth Maps in Disease Mapping
Choropleth maps use color or shading to represent statistical values across geographic areas. They are essential for visualizing
disease patterns, health indicators, and epidemiological data.
Data Requirements:
Aggregated to areas
Standardized rates
Comparable units
Quality assured
Design Principles:
Intuitive color schemes
Appropriate classifications
Clear legends
Proper labeling
Health Applications:
Disease prevalence
Mortality rates
Risk factors
Health outcomes
3. Understanding Health Data
%3.1 Malaria Prevalence Measures
Key Malaria Indicators
Prevalence
Proportion of population infected at a
specific time
IncidenceNumber of new cases per unit time
Mortality Rate
Deaths per unit population per time
period
Case Fatality
Rate
Proportion of cases that result in death
Calculation Examples
Prevalence Rate
= (Number of cases / Total population) × 100
Example: 500 cases / 10,000 people = 5%
Incidence Rate
= (New cases / Population at risk) × Time period
Example: 200 new cases / 10,000 / year = 20 per 1,000 per year

6.1 Classification Methods Comparison
Figure 6.1: Comparison of different classification methods showing how they affect data interpretation
Natural Breaks (Jenks)
Creates classes based on natural groupings in the data
distribution
When to Use:
Data has natural clusters
Want to show meaningful patterns
Default choice for most health data
Advantages:
Statistically optimal groupings
Reveals natural patterns
Good for varied distributions
Quantile (Equal Count)
Each class contains the same number of features
When to Use:
Want equal representation
Data has extreme outliers
Comparing relative positions
Advantages:
Good color distribution
Handles outliers well
Shows relative ranking
Equal Interval
Classes have equal ranges between minimum and maximum
values
When to Use:
Comparing across time/space
Data is evenly distributed
Need consistent intervals
Considerations:
May create empty classes
Sensitive to outliers
Easy to interpret
Standard Deviation
Classes based on standard deviations from the mean
When to Use:
Normally distributed data
Want to show deviation from average
Statistical analysis focus
Advantages:
Shows statistical significance
Highlights outliers
Good for research
6.2 Color Theory for Health Maps
Choosing Appropriate Colors for Disease Maps
Color selection in health mapping is crucial for effective communication and can significantly impact how audiences interpret your
data.
Sequential Colors
For ordered data (low to high prevalence)
Reds: Disease burden, mortality
Oranges: Infection rates, cases
Blues: Water-related diseases
Greens: Vaccination coverage
Diverging Colors
For data with meaningful midpoint
Red-White-Blue: Above/below target
Brown-White-Green: Decrease/increase
Use when comparing to benchmark
Center on meaningful value
Accessibility
Ensure colors work for all audiences
Colorblind-friendly palettes
High contrast ratios
Avoid red-green combinations
Test with grayscale conversion
6.3 Interpretation Guidelines
Reading Choropleth Maps
Pattern recognition: Look for spatial clusters
Outlier identification: Unusual high/low values
Boundary effects: Consider administrative boundaries
Data availability: Check for missing areas
Population density: Consider underlying population
Common Interpretation Pitfalls
Ecological fallacy: Don't assume area-level patterns apply to
individuals
Modifiable areal unit: Patterns may change with different boundaries
Visual bias: Larger areas appear more important
Color bias: Brighter colors draw more attention
Classification effects: Different methods show different patterns
