Today’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) has far surpassed the hype of blockchain and quantum 
computing. This is due to the fact that huge computing resources are easily available to 
the common man. The  developers now  take advantage of this in creating new  Machine 
Learning models and to re-train the existing models for better performance and results. 
The  easy  availability  of  High  Performance  Computing  (HPC)  has  resulted  in  a  sudden 
increased demand for IT professionals having Machine Learning skills.  
In this tutorial, you will learn in detail about: 
What is the crux of machine learning? 
 
 What are the different types in machine learning?  
 
 What  are  the  different  algorithms  available  for  developing  machine  learning 
models?  
 
 What tools are available for developing these models?  
 
 What are the programming language choices?  
 
 What  platforms  support  development  and  deployment  of  Machine  Learning 
applications?  
 
 What IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) are available?  
 
 How to quickly upgrade your skills in this important area?  
  
1. Machine Learning – Introduction 

Machine Learning

When you tag a face in a Facebook photo, it is AI that is running behind the scenes and 
identifying faces in a picture. Face tagging is now omnipresent in several applications that 
display pictures with human faces. Why just human faces? There are several applications 
that  detect  objects  such  as  cats,  dogs,  bottles,  cars,  etc.  We  have  autonomous  cars 
running on our roads that detect objects in real time to steer the car. When you travel, 
you use Google Directions to learn the real-time traffic situations and follow the best path 
suggested by Google at that point of time. This is yet another implementation of object 
detection technique in real time.  
Let us consider the example of Google Translate application that we typically use while 
visiting  foreign  countries. Google’s  online  translator  app  on  your  mobile  helps  you 
communicate with the local people speaking a language that is foreign to you.  
There are several applications of AI that we use practically today. In fact, each one of us 
use AI in many parts of our lives, even without our knowledge. Today’s AI can perform 
extremely complex jobs with a great accuracy and speed. Let us discuss an example of 
complex task to understand what capabilities are expected in an AI application that you 
would be developing today for your clients.  
Example  
We all use Google Directions during our trip anywhere in the city for a daily commute or 
even for inter-city travels. Google Directions application suggests the fastest path to our 
destination at that time instance. When we follow this path, we have observed that Google 
is almost 100% right in its suggestions and we save our valuable time on the trip.  
You can imagine the complexity involved in developing this kind of application considering 
that there are multiple paths to your destination and the application has to judge the traffic 
situation  in  every  possible  path  to give  you  a  travel  time  estimate  for  each  such  path. 
Besides,  consider  the  fact  that  Google  Directions  covers the entire  globe. Undoubtedly, 
lots of AI and Machine Learning techniques are in-use under the hoods of such applications.   
Considering the continuous demand for the development of such applications, you will now 
appreciate why there is a sudden demand for IT professionals with AI skills. 
In our next chapter, we will learn what it takes to develop AI programs.  
  
2. Machine Learning – What Today’s AI Can Do? 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  3 
 
The journey of AI began in the 1950's when the computing power was a fraction of what 
it  is today.  AI  started  out  with  the  predictions  made  by  the  machine  in  a  fashion  a 
statistician does predictions using his calculator. Thus, the initial entire AI development 
was based mainly on statistical techniques.  
In this chapter, let us discuss in detail what these statistical techniques are. 
Statistical Techniques 
The development of today’s AI applications started with using the  age-old  traditional 
statistical techniques. You must have used straight-line interpolation in schools to predict 
a future value. There are several other such statistical techniques which are successfully 
applied in developing so-called AI programs. We say “so-called” because the AI programs 
that we have today are much more complex and use techniques far beyond the statistical 
techniques used by the early AI programs.  
Some of the examples of statistical techniques that are used for developing AI applications 
in those days and are still in practice are listed here: 
 
 Regression 
 Classification 
 Clustering 
 Probability Theories 
 Decision Trees 
 
Here we have listed only some primary techniques that are enough to get you started on 
AI  without  scaring  you  of  the  vastness  that  AI demands. If  you  are  developing  AI 
applications based on limited data, you would be using these statistical techniques. 
However, today the data is abundant. To analyze the kind of huge data that we possess 
statistical techniques are  of not much help as  they have  some limitations  of their own. 
More  advanced  methods  such  as  deep  learning are  hence developed  to  solve  many 
complex problems.  
As we move ahead in this tutorial, we will understand what Machine Learning is and how 
it is used for developing such complex AI applications.  
  
3. Machine Learning – Traditional AI 

Machine Learning

Consider the following figure that shows a plot of house prices versus its size in sq. ft.  
 
 
 
After  plotting  various  data  points  on  the  XY  plot,  we  draw  a  best-fit  line  to  do  our 
predictions for any other house given its size. You will feed the known data to the machine 
and ask it to find the best fit line. Once the best fit line is found by the machine, you will 
test its suitability by feeding in a known house size, i.e. the Y-value in the above curve. 
The machine will now return the estimated X-value, i.e. the expected price of the house. 
The diagram can be extrapolated to find out the price of a house which is 3000 sq. ft. or 
even larger. This is called regression in statistics. Particularly, this kind of regression is 
called linear regression as the relationship between X & Y data points is linear.  
 
4. Machine Learning – What is Machine 
Learning? 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  5 
 
In many cases, the relationship between the X & Y data points may not be a straight line, 
and it may be a curve with a complex equation. Your task would be now to find out the 
best  fitting  curve  which  can  be  extrapolated  to  predict  the  future  values.  One  such 
application plot is shown in the figure below.

You will use the statistical optimization techniques to find out the equation for the best fit 
curve  here.  And this  is  what exactly  Machine  Learning  is  about.  You  use  known 
optimization techniques to find the best solution to your problem.  
 
Next, let us look at the different categories of Machine Learning.  
  

Machine Learning   
 
 
  6 
 
Machine Learning is broadly categorized under the following headings: 
 
 
Machine learning evolved from left to right as shown in the above diagram.  
 Initially, researchers started  out  with  Supervised  Learning.  This  is  the  case  of 
housing price prediction discussed earlier.  
 
 This was followed by unsupervised learning, where the machine is made to learn 
on its own without any supervision.  
 
 Scientists  discovered  further  that it  may  be  a  good  idea  to  reward  the  machine 
when it does the job the expected way and there came the Reinforcement Learning. 
 
 Very soon, the data that is available these days has become so humongous that 
the  conventional  techniques  developed  so  far  failed  to  analyze  the  big  data  and 
provide us the predictions.  
 
 Thus, came the deep learning where the human brain is simulated in the Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANN) created in our binary computers. 
 
 The  machine  now  learns  on  its  own  using  the  high  computing  power  and  huge 
memory resources that are available today.  
 
 It is now observed that Deep Learning has solved many of the previously unsolvable 
problems.  
 
 The  technique  is  now  further  advanced  by  giving  incentives  to  Deep  Learning 
networks as awards and there finally comes Deep Reinforcement Learning.  
 
5. Machine Learning – Categories of Machine 
Learning 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  7 
 
Let us now study each of these categories in more detail.  
Supervised Learning 
Supervised learning is analogous to training a child to walk. You will hold the child’s hand, 
show him how to take his foot forward, walk yourself for a demonstration and so on, until 
the child learns to walk on his own.  
Regression 
Similarly, in the case of supervised learning, you give concrete  known examples to the 
computer. You say that for given feature value x1 the output is y1, for x2 it is y2, for x3 
it  is  y3,  and  so  on.  Based  on  this  data, you let  the  computer  figure  out  an  empirical 
relationship between x and y.  
Once the machine is trained in this way with a sufficient number of data points, now you 
would ask the machine to predict Y for a given X. Assuming that you know the real value 
of Y for this given X, you will be able to deduce whether the machine’s prediction is correct. 
Thus, you will test whether the machine has learned by using the known test data. Once 
you  are  satisfied  that  the  machine  is  able  to  do  the  predictions  with  a  desired  level  of 
accuracy (say 80 to 90%) you can stop further training the machine.  
Now, you can safely use the machine to do the predictions on unknown data points, or ask 
the machine to predict Y for a given X for which you do not know the real value of Y. This 
training comes under the regression that we talked about earlier.  
Classification 
You may also use machine learning techniques for classification problems. In classification 
problems, you classify objects of similar nature into a single group. For example, in a set 
of 100 students say, you may like to group them into three groups based on their heights 
- short, medium and long. Measuring the height of each student, you will place them in a 
proper group.  
Now, when a new student comes in, you will put him in an appropriate group by measuring 
his height. By following the principles in regression training, you will train the machine to 
classify a student based on his feature – the height. When the machine learns how the 
groups are  formed, it will be able to classify any unknown new  student correctly. Once 
again, you would use the test data to verify that the machine has learned your technique 
of classification before putting the developed model in production.  
Supervised Learning is where the AI really began its journey. This technique was applied 
successfully  in several  cases.  You  have  used  this  model  while  doing  the  hand-written 
recognition  on  your  machine.  Several  algorithms  have  been  developed  for  supervised 
learning. You will learn about them in the following chapters. 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  8 
 
Unsupervised Learning 
In unsupervised learning, we do not specify a target variable to the machine, rather we 
ask machine “What can you tell me about X?”. More specifically, we may ask questions 
such as given a huge data set X, “What are the five best groups we can make out of X?” 
or “What features occur together most frequently in X?”. To arrive at the answers to such 
questions,  you  can  understand  that  the  number  of  data  points  that  the  machine  would 
require  to  deduce  a  strategy  would  be  very  large.  In  case  of  supervised  learning,  the 
machine can be trained with even about few thousands of data points. However, in case 
of  unsupervised  learning,  the  number  of  data  points  that  is  reasonably  accepted  for 
learning starts in a few millions. These days, the data is generally abundantly available. 
The  data  ideally  requires  curating.  However,  the  amount  of  data  that  is  continuously 
flowing in a social area network, in most cases data curation is an impossible task.  
 
The following figure shows the boundary between the yellow and red dots as determined 
by unsupervised machine learning. You can see it clearly that the machine would be able 
to determine the class of each of the black dots with a fairly good accuracy.

The unsupervised learning has shown a great  success in many modern AI applications, 
such as face detection, object detection, and so on.

Reinforcement Learning 
Consider training a pet dog, we train our pet to bring a ball to us. We throw the ball at a 
certain distance and ask the dog to fetch it back to us. Every time the dog does this right, 
we reward the dog. Slowly, the dog learns that doing the job rightly gives him a reward 
and then the dog starts doing the job right way every time in future. Exactly, this concept 
is applied in “Reinforcement” type of learning. The technique was initially developed for 
machines to play games. The machine is given an algorithm to analyze all possible moves 
at each stage of the game. The machine may select one of the moves at random. If the 
move  is  right,  the  machine  is  rewarded,  otherwise  it  may  be  penalized.  Slowly,  the 
machine  will  start  differentiating  between  right  and  wrong  moves  and  after  several 
iterations would learn to solve the game puzzle with a better accuracy. The accuracy of 
winning the game would improve as the machine plays more and more games.  
 
The entire process may be depicted in the following diagram: 
 
 
 
This technique of machine learning differs from the supervised learning in that you need 
not supply the labelled input/output pairs. The focus is  on finding the balance between 
exploring the new solutions versus exploiting the learned solutions.  

Machine Learning   
 
 
  10 
 
Deep Learning 
The deep learning is a model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), more specifically 
Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)s. There  are  several  architectures  used  in  deep 
learning such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, 
and convolutional neural networks.  
These networks have been successfully applied in solving the problems of computer vision, 
speech  recognition,  natural  language  processing,  bioinformatics,  drug  design,  medical 
image  analysis,  and  games.  There  are  several  other  fields  in  which  deep  learning  is 
proactively applied. The deep learning requires huge processing power and humongous 
data, which is generally easily available these days.  
We will talk about deep learning more in detail in the coming chapters. 
Deep Reinforcement Learning  
The  Deep  Reinforcement  Learning  (DRL)  combines  the  techniques  of  both  deep  and 
reinforcement  learning.  The  reinforcement  learning  algorithms  like  Q-learning  are  now 
combined with deep learning to create a powerful DRL model. The technique has been with 
a  great  success  in  the  fields  of  robotics,  video  games,  finance  and  healthcare.  Many 
previously unsolvable problems are now solved by creating DRL models. There is lots of 
research going on in this area and this is very actively pursued by the industries.  
So far, you have got a brief introduction to various machine learning models, now let us 
explore slightly deeper into various algorithms that are available under these models.  
  

Machine Learning   
 
 
  11 
 
Supervised  learning  is  one  of  the  important  models  of  learning  involved  in  training 
machines. This chapter talks in detail about the same. 
Algorithms for Supervised Learning 
There are several algorithms available for supervised learning. Some of the widely used 
algorithms of supervised learning are as shown below: 
 
 k-Nearest Neighbours 
 Decision Trees 
 Naive Bayes 
 Logistic Regression 
 Support Vector Machines 
As we move ahead in this chapter, let us discuss in detail about each of the algorithms. 
k-Nearest Neighbours 
The k-Nearest Neighbours, which is simply called kNN is a statistical technique that can 
be used for solving for classification and regression problems. Let us discuss the case of 
classifying an unknown object using kNN. Consider the distribution of objects as shown in 
the image given below: 
 
 
 
Source: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm 
 
6. Machine Learning – Supervised Learning 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  12 
 
The diagram shows three types of objects, marked in red, blue and green colors. When 
you run the kNN classifier on the above dataset, the boundaries for each type of object 
will be marked as shown below: 
 
 
 
Source: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm 
 
Now, consider a new unknown object that you want to classify as red, green or blue. This 
is depicted in the figure below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  13 
 
As  you  see  it  visually,  the  unknown  data  point  belongs  to  a  class  of  blue  objects. 
Mathematically, this can be concluded by measuring the distance of this unknown point 
with every  other point in the data  set.  When you do so,  you will know  that most of its 
neighbours  are  of  blue  color.  The  average  distance  to  red  and  green  objects  would  be 
definitely more than the average distance to blue objects. Thus, this unknown object can 
be classified as belonging to blue class.   
 
The  kNN  algorithm  can  also  be  used  for  regression  problems.  The  kNN  algorithm  is 
available as ready-to-use in most of the ML libraries.  
Decision Trees 
A simple decision tree in a flowchart format is shown below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You would write a code to classify your input data based on this flowchart. The flowchart 
is self-explanatory and trivial. In this scenario, you are trying to classify an incoming email 
to decide when to read it.  
In  reality,  the  decision  trees  can  be  large  and  complex.  There  are  several  algorithms 
available to create and traverse these trees. As a Machine Learning enthusiast, you need 
to understand and master these techniques of creating and traversing decision trees.  

Machine Learning   
 
 
  14 
 
Naive Bayes 
Naive Bayes is used for creating classifiers. Suppose you want to sort out (classify) fruits 
of different kinds from a fruit basket. You may use features such as color, size and shape 
of a fruit, For example, any fruit that is red in color, is round in shape and is about 10 cm 
in diameter  may  be  considered  as  Apple.  So  to  train  the  model,  you  would  use  these 
features and test the probability that a given feature matches the desired constraints. The 
probabilities of different features are then combined to arrive at a probability that a given 
fruit  is  an  Apple.  Naive  Bayes  generally  requires  a  small  number  of  training  data  for 
classification.  
Logistic Regression 
Look at the following diagram. It shows the distribution of data points in XY plane.  
 
 
 
From the diagram, we can visually inspect the separation of red dots from green dots. You 
may draw a boundary line to separate out these dots. Now, to classify a new data point, 
you will just need to determine on which side of the line the point lies.  

Machine Learning   
 
 
  15 
 
Support Vector Machines 
Look at the following distribution of data. Here the three classes of data cannot be linearly 
separated. The boundary curves are non-linear. In such a case, finding the equation of the 
curve becomes a complex job.  
 
 
 
Source: http://uc-r.github.io/svm 
 
The  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM)  comes  handy  in  determining  the  separation 
boundaries in such situations.  
  

Machine Learning   
 
 
  16 
 
Fortunately, most of the time you do not have to code the algorithms mentioned in the 
previous  lesson.  There  are  many  standard  libraries  which  provide  the  ready-to-use 
implementation of these algorithms. One such toolkit that is popularly used is scikit-learn. 
The figure below illustrates the kind of algorithms which are available for your use in this 
library.  
 
 
 
 
Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html 
 
The use of these algorithms is trivial and since these are well and field tested, you can 
safely use them in your AI applications. Most of these libraries are free to use even for 
commercial purposes.  
 
 
 
 
  
7. Machine Learning – Scikit-learn Algorithm 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  17 
 
So far what you have seen is making the machine learn to find out the solution to our 
target. In regression, we train the machine to predict a future value. In classification, we 
train the machine to classify an unknown object in one of the categories defined by us. In 
short, we have been training machines so that it can predict Y for our data X. Given a huge 
data set and not estimating the categories, it would be difficult for us to train the machine 
using  supervised  learning.  What  if  the  machine  can  look  up  and analyze  the  big  data 
running into several Gigabytes and Terabytes and tell us that this data contains so many 
distinct categories?  
As an example, consider the voter’s data. By considering some inputs from each voter 
(these are called features in AI terminology), let the machine predict  that there are so 
many voters who would vote for X political party and so many would vote for Y, and so 
on. Thus, in general, we are asking the machine given a huge set of data points X, “What 
can you tell me about X?”. Or it may be a question like “What are the five best groups we 
can make out of X?”. Or it could be even like “What three features occur together most 
frequently in X?”. 
 
This is exactly the Unsupervised Learning is all about.   
Algorithms for Unsupervised Learning 
Let  us  now  discuss  one  of  the  widely  used  algorithms  for  classification  in  unsupervised 
machine learning. 
k-means clustering 
The 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections in the United States were close — very close. 
The largest percentage of the popular vote that any candidate received was 50.7% and 
the  lowest  was  47.9%.  If  a  percentage  of  the  voters  were  to  have  switched  sides, the 
outcome of the election would have been different. There are small groups of voters who, 
when properly appealed to, will switch sides. These groups may not be huge, but with such 
close races, they may be big enough to change the outcome of the election. How do you 
find these groups of people? How do you appeal to them with a limited budget? The answer 
is clustering. 
Let us understand how it is done.  
 First, you collect information on people either with or without their consent: any 
sort of information that might give some clue about what is important to them and 
what will influence how they vote.  
 
 
 Then you put this information into some sort of clustering algorithm.  
 
8. Machine Learning – Unsupervised Learning 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  18 
 
 Next, for each cluster (it would be smart to choose the largest one first) you craft 
a message that will appeal to these voters.  
 
 Finally, you deliver the campaign and measure to see if it’s working. 
 
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that automatically forms clusters of similar 
things. It is like automatic classification. You can cluster almost anything, and the more 
similar the items are in the cluster, the better the clusters are.  In this chapter, we are 
going  to  study  one  type  of  clustering  algorithm  called  k-means.  It  is  called  k-means 
because it finds ‘k’ unique clusters, and the center of each cluster is the mean of the values 
in that cluster.  
Cluster Identification 
Cluster identification tells an algorithm, “Here’s some data. Now group similar things 
together and tell me about those groups.” The key difference from classification is that in 
classification you know what you are looking for. While that is not the case in clustering.  
Clustering is sometimes called unsupervised classification because it produces the same 
result as classification does but without having predefined classes. 
Now, we are comfortable with both supervised and unsupervised learning. To understand 
the  rest  of  the  machine  learning  categories, we must  first  understand  Artificial  Neural 
Networks (ANN), which we will learn in the next chapter.

The idea of artificial neural networks was derived from the neural networks in the human 
brain. The human brain is really complex. Carefully studying the brain, the scientists and 
engineers  came  up  with  an  architecture  that  could  fit  in  our  digital  world  of  binary 
computers. One such typical architecture is shown in the diagram below: 
 
 
 
There is an input layer which has many sensors to collect data from the outside world. On 
the  right  hand  side,  we  have  an  output  layer  that  gives  us  the  result  predicted  by  the 
network.  In  between these  two, several  layers  are  hidden.  Each  additional  layer  adds 
further complexity in training the network, but would provide better results in most of the 
situations. There are several types of architectures designed which we will discuss now.

Each  architecture  is  developed  for  a  specific  type  of  application.  Thus,  when  you  use  a 
neural network for your machine learning application, you will have to use either one of 
the existing architecture or design your own. The type of application that you finally decide 
upon depends on your application needs. There is no single guideline that tells you to use 
a specific network architecture.

Deep Learning uses ANN. First we will look at a few deep learning applications that will 
give you an idea of its power.  
Applications 
Deep Learning has shown a lot of success in several areas of machine learning applications.  
Self-driving Cars: The autonomous self-driving cars use deep learning techniques. They 
generally adapt to the ever changing traffic situations and get better and better at driving 
over a period of time.  
Speech  Recognition: Another  interesting  application  of  Deep  Learning  is  speech 
recognition. All of us use several mobile apps today that are capable of recognizing our 
speech. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortena and Google’s Assistant – all these 
use deep learning techniques.   
Mobile Apps: We use several web-based and mobile apps for organizing our photos. Face 
detection,  face  ID,  face  tagging,  identifying  objects  in  an  image – all  these  use  deep 
learning.  
Untapped Opportunities of Deep Learning 
After  looking  at  the  great  success  deep  learning  applications  have  achieved  in  many 
domains, people started exploring other domains where machine learning was not so far 
applied. There  are  several  domains  in  which  deep  learning  techniques  are  successfully 
applied  and  there  are many  other domains  which can be  exploited.  Some  of  these  are 
discussed here: 
 Agriculture is one such industry where people can apply deep learning techniques 
to improve the crop yield.  
 
 Consumer  finance  is  another  area  where  machine  learning  can  greatly  help  in 
providing early detection on frauds and analyzing customer’s ability to pay.  
 
 Deep learning techniques are also applied to the field of medicine to create new 
drugs and provide a personalized prescription to a patient.  
The  possibilities  are  endless  and  one  has  to  keep  watching  as  the  new  ideas  and 
developments pop up frequently.

What is Required for Achieving More Using Deep Learning? 
To use deep learning, supercomputing power is a mandatory requirement. You need both 
memory as well as the CPU to develop deep learning models. Fortunately, today we have 
an easy availability of HPC – High Performance Computing. Due to this, the development 
of the deep learning applications that we mentioned above became a reality today and in 
the  future too we can see  the  applications  in  those  untapped  areas that  we  discussed 
earlier. 
Now, we will look at some of the limitations of deep learning that we must consider before 
using it in our machine learning application.  
Deep Learning - Disadvantages 
Some of the important points that you need to consider before using deep learning are 
listed below: 
 Black Box approach 
 Duration of Development 
 Amount of Data 
 Computationally Expensive 
We will now study each one of these limitations in detail. 
Black Box approach 
An  ANN  is  like  a  blackbox.  You  give  it  a  certain  input  and it  will  provide  you  a  specific 
output. The following diagram shows you one such application where you feed an animal 
image to a neural network and it tells you that the image is of a dog.  
 
Why this is called a black-box approach is that you do not know why the network came up 
with a certain result. You do not know how the network concluded that it is a dog? Now 
consider a banking application where the bank wants to decide the creditworthiness of a 
client. The network will definitely provide you an answer to this question. However, will 
you be able to justify it to a client? Banks need to explain it to their customers why the 
loan is not sanctioned? 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  24 
 
Duration of Development 
The process of training a neural network is depicted in the diagram below: 
 
You first define the problem that you want to solve, create a specification for it, decide on 
the input features, design a network, deploy it and test the output. If the output is not as 
expected, take this as a feedback to restructure your network. This is an iterative process 
and may require several iterations until the time network is fully trained to produce desired 
outputs.  
Amount of Data 
The deep learning networks usually require a huge amount of data for training, while the 
traditional machine learning algorithms can be used with a great success even with just a 
few thousands of data points. Fortunately, the data abundance is growing at 40% per year 
and CPU processing power is growing at 20% per year as seen in the diagram given below: 
 
 

Machine Learning   
 
 
  25 
 
Computationally Expensive 
Training a neural network requires several times more computational power than the one 
required  in  running  traditional  algorithms.  Successful  training  of  deep  Neural  Networks 
may require several weeks of training time.  
In contrast to this, traditional machine learning algorithms take only a few minutes/hours 
to train. Also, the amount of computational power needed for training deep neural network 
heavily depends on the size of your data and how deep and complex the network is? 
After  having  an  overview  of  what  Machine  Learning is,  its  capabilities,  limitations,  and 
applications, let us now dive into learning “Machine Learning”.

Machine Learning has a very large width and requires skills across several domains. The 
skills that you need to acquire for becoming an expert in Machine Learning are listed below: 
 
 Statistics 
 Probability Theories 
 Calculus 
 Optimization techniques 
 Visualization 
Necessity of Various Skills of Machine Learning 
To give you a brief idea of what skills you need to acquire, let us discuss some examples: 
Mathematical Notation 
Most of the machine learning algorithms are heavily based on mathematics. The level of 
mathematics that you need to know is probably just a beginner level. What is important 
is that you should be able to read the notation that mathematicians use in their equations. 
For example - if you are able to read the notation and comprehend what it means, you 
are ready for  learning  machine  learning.  If  not,  you  may  need  to  brush  up  your 
mathematics knowledge.

conditional probabilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With these definitions, we can define the Bayesian classification rule: 
 If P(c
1
|x, y) > P(c
2
|x, y) , the class is c
1
 . 
 If P(c
1
|x, y) < P(c
2
|x, y) , the class is c
2
 . 
Optimization Problem

Visualization 
In  many  cases,  you  will  need  to  understand  the  various  types  of  visualization  plots  to 
understand your data distribution and interpret the results of the algorithm’s output.  
 
 
 
Besides the above theoretical aspects of machine learning, you need good programming 
skills to code those algorithms.  
 
So what does it take to implement ML? Let us look into this in the next chapter.

To  develop  ML  applications,  you  will  have  to  decide  on  the  platform,  the  IDE  and  the 
language for development. There are several choices available. Most of these would meet 
your  requirements  easily  as  all  of  them  provide  the  implementation  of  AI  algorithms 
discussed so far.  
If  you  are  developing  the  ML  algorithm  on  your  own, the  following  aspects  need  to  be  
understood carefully: 
The language of your choice – this essentially is your proficiency in one of the languages 
supported in ML development.   
The IDE that you use – This would depend on your familiarity with the existing IDEs and 
your comfort level.  
Development  platform – There are  several  platforms  available  for  development  and 
deployment. Most of these are free-to-use. In some cases, you may have to incur a license 
fee beyond a certain amount of usage. Here is a brief list of choice of languages, IDEs and 
platforms for your ready reference.  
Language Choice 
Here is a list of languages that support ML development: 
 Python 
 R 
 Matlab 
 Octave 
 Julia 
 C++ 
 C 
This  list  is  not  essentially  comprehensive;  however,  it  covers  many  popular  languages 
used  in  machine  learning  development.  Depending  upon  your  comfort  level,  select  a 
language for the development, develop your models and test.

This  tutorial  has  introduced  you  to  Machine  Learning.  Now,  you  know  that  Machine 
Learning is a technique of training machines to perform the activities a human brain can 
do, albeit bit faster and better than an average human-being. Today we have seen that 
the machines can beat human champions in games such as Chess, AlphaGO, which are 
considered very complex. You have seen that machines can be trained to perform human 
activities in several areas and can aid humans in living better lives.  
Machine Learning can be a Supervised or Unsupervised. If you have lesser amount of data 
and clearly labelled data for training, opt for Supervised Learning. Unsupervised Learning 
would  generally  give  better  performance  and  results  for  large  data  sets.  If  you  have  a 
huge  data  set  easily  available,  go  for  deep  learning  techniques.  You also have  learned 
Reinforcement  Learning  and  Deep  Reinforcement  Learning.  You  now  know  what  Neural 
Networks are, their applications and limitations.  
Finally, when it comes to the development of machine learning models of your own, you 
looked at the choices of various development languages, IDEs and Platforms. Next thing 
that you need to do is start learning and practicing each machine learning technique. The 
subject is vast, it means that there is width, but if you consider the depth, each topic can 
be learned in a few hours. Each topic is independent of each other. You need to take into 
consideration one topic at a time, learn it, practice it and implement the algorithm/s in it 
using a language choice of yours. This is the best way to start studying Machine Learning. 
Practicing one topic at a time, very soon you would acquire the width that is eventually 
required of a Machine Learning expert.  
Good Luck!
