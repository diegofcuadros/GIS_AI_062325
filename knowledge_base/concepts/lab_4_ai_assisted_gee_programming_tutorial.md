• Pattern recognition
• Documentation help
⚠ Limitations
• May produce errors
• Context limitations
• Requires validation
• No real-time data
Conversational Programming Approach
 Your Prompt
"I need to load MODIS NDVI data for Uganda in
2023, calculate the mean, and display it with a
green color palette. Can you write the GEE
JavaScript code?"
烙 ChatGPT Response
// Load Uganda boundary
var uganda =
ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017')
.filter(ee.Filter.eq('country_na', 'Uganda'));
// Load and process MODIS NDVI
var ndvi =
ee.ImageCollection('MODIS/061/MOD13Q1')
.filterDate('2023-01-01', '2023-12-31')
.select('NDVI')
.mean()
.clip(uganda);
// Display on map
Map.centerObject(uganda, 6);
Map.addLayer(ndvi, {min: 0, max: 8000, palette:
['white', 'green']}, 'NDVI');

Step-by-Step Tutorial
1
Initial Setup
Open Required Platforms
 Google Earth Engine
Navigate to code.earthengine.google.com
烙 ChatGPT
Open chat.openai.com in a new tab
Create New Script
// In GEE Code Editor: // 1. Click "NEW" button // 2.

folder
2
Generate Your First Code
 Copy This Prompt to ChatGPT:
Write Google Earth Engine JavaScript code that: 1. Loads the CHIRPS Daily rainfall dataset ('UCSB-
CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY') 2. Filters data for July 2023 (2023-07-01 to 2023-07-31) 3. Calculates the total rainfall
for that month using .sum() 4. Clips the result to Uganda's boundary using 'USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017' 5.
