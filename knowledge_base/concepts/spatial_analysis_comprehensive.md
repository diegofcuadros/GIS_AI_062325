# Spatial Analysis: From Patterns to Processes

# Spatial Analysis: Understanding Geographic Patterns

## What is Spatial Analysis?

**Spatial Analysis** goes beyond visualization to understand **why** spatial patterns exist and **what processes** created them.

### GIS vs. Spatial Analysis:
- **GIS**: "What is where?" - Data manipulation, querying, visualization
- **Spatial Analysis**: "Why is it there?" - Statistical analysis of patterns and processes

### The Spatial Analysis Workflow:
1. **Visualize**: Create maps to see patterns
2. **Describe**: Quantify spatial patterns statistically  
3. **Explain**: Test hypotheses about underlying processes
4. **Predict**: Model future patterns or scenarios

## Core Spatial Analysis Concepts

### 1. Scale and Resolution
**Scale** in geography refers to the ratio of map distance to real-world distance:
- **Large scale** (e.g., 1:10,000): Small area, high detail
- **Small scale** (e.g., 1:1,000,000): Large area, low detail

**Resolution** affects what patterns we can detect:
- **Fine resolution**: See individual buildings, trees
- **Coarse resolution**: See regional patterns, climate zones

### 2. Object vs. Field View
**Object View**: Treats features as discrete entities
- Examples: Cities, hospitals, disease cases
- Best for: Counting, location analysis, network analysis

**Field View**: Treats phenomena as continuous surfaces
- Examples: Temperature, elevation, population density
- Best for: Interpolation, surface analysis, modeling

### 3. Spatial Relationships
**Topological relationships** describe how features relate spatially:
- **Adjacent**: Share a boundary
- **Contains**: One feature inside another
- **Overlaps**: Partial overlap between features
- **Disjoint**: No spatial relationship

**Distance relationships**:
- **Euclidean distance**: Straight-line distance
- **Network distance**: Distance along roads/paths
- **Travel time**: Time-based accessibility

### 4. Spatial Patterns
**Random**: Features distributed without spatial pattern
**Clustered**: Features grouped together more than expected
**Dispersed**: Features more spread out than expected

## Statistical Measures of Spatial Pattern

### Point Pattern Analysis:
- **Nearest neighbor analysis**: Measures clustering vs. dispersion
- **Quadrat analysis**: Compares observed vs. expected distributions
- **Kernel density estimation**: Creates smooth density surfaces

### Spatial Autocorrelation:
- **Positive autocorrelation**: Similar values cluster together
- **Negative autocorrelation**: Different values are neighbors
- **No autocorrelation**: Values distributed randomly

**Moran's I**: Measures global spatial autocorrelation
- **I > 0**: Clustered pattern
- **I = 0**: Random pattern  
- **I < 0**: Dispersed pattern

## Applications in Health Research

### Disease Surveillance:
1. **Map disease cases** to identify spatial patterns
2. **Test for clustering** using statistical methods
3. **Identify risk factors** through spatial correlation
4. **Predict spread** using spatial models

### Healthcare Access:
1. **Map facilities and populations** to assess coverage
2. **Calculate travel distances/times** to measure access
3. **Identify service gaps** where access is poor
4. **Optimize locations** for new facilities

### Environmental Health:
1. **Map exposure sources** (pollution, contamination)
2. **Model exposure surfaces** using interpolation
3. **Correlate health outcomes** with environmental factors
4. **Assess environmental justice** through spatial equity analysis

## Tools for Spatial Analysis

### R Programming:
- **Spatial packages**: sf, sp, rgdal, raster
- **Statistical analysis**: Comprehensive spatial statistics
- **Reproducible research**: Script-based workflows
- **Visualization**: Advanced mapping and plotting

### Python:
- **Spatial libraries**: GeoPandas, Shapely, Rasterio
- **Machine learning**: scikit-learn for spatial ML
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter for interactive analysis

### Specialized Software:
- **GeoDa**: Free spatial analysis software
- **ArcGIS Spatial Analyst**: Commercial spatial analysis extension
- **QGIS + R**: Combine QGIS visualization with R analysis
