## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Options**

### **Option 1: Quick Start (Local Knowledge Base)**
**Ready in 10 minutes** - No API keys needed, works offline

```typescript
import { WorkshopContentChatbot } from "@/components/ai/workshop-content-chatbot"

// Add to any lab page
<WorkshopContentChatbot 
  currentLab="lab1"
  currentStep={2}
/>
```

**Capabilities:**
- Answers 50+ common workshop questions instantly
- Provides step-by-step guidance for all lab procedures
- Troubleshoots QGIS, Python, and Google Earth Engine issues
- Explains key concepts (CRS, NDVI, spatial analysis, etc.)

### **Option 2: AI-Powered (OpenAI/Claude)**
**Professional grade** - Handles any question intelligently

```typescript
import { WorkshopContentChatbot } from "@/components/ai/workshop-content-chatbot"
import { WorkshopAIService } from "@/lib/ai-service"

// Set up AI service
const aiService = new WorkshopAIService("openai", "your-api-key")

// Use with chatbot
<WorkshopContentChatbot 
  currentLab="lab3"
  currentStep={4}
  onMessage={async (message, context) => {
    return await aiService.generateResponse(message, context)
  }}
/>
```

**Additional Capabilities:**
- Answers ANY workshop-related question intelligently
- Adapts responses to student's specific context
- Learns from conversation for better follow-up responses
- Handles complex, multi-part questions

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
**Best of both worlds** - Fast local responses + AI for complex questions

```typescript
// Falls back to AI for unknown questions
const handleMessage = async (message: string, context: any) => {
  // Try local knowledge base first (instant)
  const localResponse = await localService.generateResponse(message, context)
  
  // If local response is generic, use AI
  if (localResponse.includes("Can you provide more details")) {
    return await aiService.generateResponse(message, context)
  }
  
  return localResponse
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Add to Your Workshop Pages**

```tsx
// In your lab page component
import { WorkshopContentChatbot } from "@/components/ai/workshop-content-chatbot"

export default function Lab1Page() {
  return (
    <div className="lab-content">
      {/* Your existing lab content */}
      
      {/* Add the AI chatbot */}
      <WorkshopContentChatbot 
        currentLab="lab1"
        currentStep={1}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### **Step 2: Configure AI Service (Optional)**

Create `.env.local`:
```bash
# Choose your AI provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-claude-key-here
```

Create `lib/workshop-ai.ts`:
```typescript
import { WorkshopAIService } from "./ai-service"

export const workshopAI = new WorkshopAIService(
  process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? "openai" : "local",
  process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
)
```

### **Step 3: Integrate with Lab Context**

```tsx
// Track student progress and provide context
const [currentLab, setCurrentLab] = useState("lab1")
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1)

<WorkshopContentChatbot 
  currentLab={currentLab}
  currentStep={currentStep}
  onMessage={async (message, context) => {
    return await workshopAI.generateResponse(message, context)
  }}
/>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example Interactions**

### **Student**: "How do I load shapefiles in QGIS?"
**AI Response**: 
```
To load data in QGIS:
1. Go to Layer â†’ Add Layer â†’ Add Vector Layer
2. Browse to your shapefile (.shp)  
3. Click 'Add'
4. Ensure all shapefile components (.shx, .dbf, .prj) are in the same folder

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use forward slashes (/) in file paths, even on Windows
```

### **Student**: "I'm getting an invalid geometry error"
**AI Response**:
```
ðŸ”§ Invalid Geometry Error

This usually means your shapefile has corrupted geometries.

Solution: Vector â†’ Geometry Tools â†’ Fix Geometries

Steps:
1. Select the problematic layer
2. Go to Vector â†’ Geometry Tools â†’ Fix Geometries  
3. Choose output location
4. Replace original layer with fixed version
```

### **Student**: "What does NDVI measure?"
**AI Response**:
```
ðŸ“– NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

Formula: (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

NDVI measures vegetation health using red and near-infrared light. Values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation.

In Lab 3, you'll calculate this using:
var ndvi = image.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4']).rename('NDVI');
